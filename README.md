# Boid Simulation with Cluster Detection
This project implements a **boids simulation**, inspired by Craig Reynolds' "Boids" model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), which mimics the collective behavior of bird flocks, fish schools, or other agent-based systems. The simulation features customizable behaviors and cluster detection using the `DBSCAN` algorithm.

- Installation

   git clone https://github.com/igorcruz91/abm_boids.git
   cd abm_boids

- Requirements
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- Running the simulation
  ```bash
  python boids_simulation.py
